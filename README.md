# "ProgressiveJS" Typescript Backend Framework.


    Project that was made to show up my skills.

    The main features are:
      - it is based on http.
      - it has custom schema validator,
      that is inspired by Ajv JSON schema validator. 
      - It's destiny to be flexible, minimalistic and convenient.
